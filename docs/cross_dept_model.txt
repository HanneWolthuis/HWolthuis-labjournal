@1
Estimation by stochastic approximation algorithm.
=================================================

Random initialization of random number stream.
Current random number seed is 419723.
Effects object used: myeff 
Model Type:
 Forcing model 
Note that the model type requested has been over-ridden
Estimation method: conditional moment estimation.
Conditioning variable is the total number of observed changes ("distance") 
in the network variable.
Distance for simulations is  536 .
Standard errors are estimated with the likelihood ratio method.
Dolby method (regression on scores) is used.
Initial value of gain parameter is  0.2000000.
Reduction factor for gain parameter is  0.5000000.
Number of subphases in Phase 2 is 4.

Initial parameter values are 
  0. Rate parameter                           3.8163
  1. eval:  degree (density)                               -1.6936
  2. eval:  same dept_cov                                   0.0000


Values of target statistics are
  1. Number of edges                                                    237.0000
  2. number ties between same dept_cov                                  420.0000
These were calculated from the data.

 2 parameters, 2 statistics

@2
End of stochastic approximation algorithm, phase 3.
---------------------------------------------------

Total of 1812 iterations.
Parameter estimates based on 812 iterations,
basic rate parameter as well as 
convergence diagnostics, covariance and derivative matrices based on 1000 iterations.

Information for convergence diagnosis.
Averages, standard deviations, and t-ratios for deviations from targets:
  1.   0.6020  13.2106   0.0456 
  2.   1.4340  25.0633   0.0572 

Good convergence is indicated by the t-ratios being close to zero.

Overall maximum convergence ratio =  0.0609 .

Rate parameters:
 0. Rate parameter                            2.4725  (   0.2814)

Other parameters:
 1. eval:  degree (density)                                       -4.0556  (   0.1935)
 2. eval:  same dept_cov                                           1.6656  (   0.1860)


@3
Covariance matrices
                   
Covariance matrix of estimates (correlations below diagonal):
     0.037     -0.034
    -0.933      0.035

Derivative matrix of expected statistics X by parameters and
covariance/correlation matrix of X can be found using
summary(ans) within R, or by using the 'verbose' option in Siena07.
 
Total computation time 32.45 seconds.
